# 🤖 Job Search AI Agent System

> **Multi-step job search automation powered by Claude**

Stop manually searching for jobs, analyzing requirements, and preparing for interviews. Let AI agents do the heavy lifting while you focus on landing your dream role.

This system uses **4 specialized AI agents** that collaborate to give you:
- 🔍 **Current job listings** from real APIs (Adzuna)
- 📚 **Personalized skills roadmap** - what to learn and how
- 🎤 **Interview prep materials** - questions + strategies
- 💼 **Career advice** - resume, LinkedIn, and application tips

**All in one automated report. All tailored to your specific job search.**

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Cool?

1. **Real multi-agent collaboration** - Agents pass context to each other, building on previous work
2. **Powered by Claude (Anthropic)** - State-of-the-art AI with excellent reasoning
3. **Live job data** - Integrates with Adzuna API for real, current job listings
4. **Production-ready code** - Error handling, retries, logging, tests
5. **Actually useful** - Generate a report you can use for your real job search

### Example Output

After running `uv run main.py`, you get a comprehensive report with:

```
✅ 5 Data Science Intern jobs in Los Angeles
📊 Analysis of required skills across all listings
📚 Learning roadmap: "Start with Python basics (2-3 weeks), then..."
🎤 10 interview questions per role with STAR method guidance
💼 Resume keywords to add, LinkedIn optimization tips, networking strategies
```

See [examples/example_output.txt](examples/example_output.txt) for a full sample report.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **uv package manager** ([Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **Anthropic API key** ([Get one](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- **Adzuna API credentials** ([Sign up - free](https://developer.adzuna.com/))

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/byrencheema/job-search-agent.git
cd job-search-agent

# 2. Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# 4. Run the system!
uv run main.py
```

That's it! The system will:
1. Search for jobs (default: "Data Science Intern" in "Los Angeles")
2. Analyze required skills
3. Generate interview prep materials
4. Provide career strategy advice
5. Save everything to `outputs/job_search_report_[timestamp].txt`

---

## 📋 Detailed Setup

### Step 1: Get API Keys

#### Anthropic Claude API

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)
6. **Note:** You may need to add credits ($5 minimum). First-time users often get free credits.

#### Adzuna Job Search API

1. Go to [developer.adzuna.com](https://developer.adzuna.com/)
2. Click "Register for API access"
3. Fill out the form (it's free!)
4. You'll receive:
   - App ID (a number)
   - API Key (a long string)
5. **Free tier:** 250 API calls/month (more than enough for this workshop)

### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` in your text editor:

```bash
# Add your actual keys here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
ADZUNA_APP_ID=12345
ADZUNA_API_KEY=your-adzuna-key-here
```

**Important:** Never commit `.env` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore` for safety.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Or using traditional pip:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Test that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
uv run python -c "from src.config import validate_config, print_config; print_config(); print(validate_config())"
```

You should see your configuration printed with ✓ marks for all API keys.

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Usage

Run with default settings (Data Science Intern in Los Angeles):

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Customize Your Search

Edit `main.py` to change search parameters:

```python
# At the top of main.py, change these:
JOB_ROLE = "Machine Learning Engineer"  # Your desired role
LOCATION = "San Francisco"               # Your target location
NUM_RESULTS = 10                         # How many jobs to analyze
```

Then run:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

### What You'll See

The system runs for 3-5 minutes, showing:
1. ✅ Configuration validation
2. 🤖 Agent creation
3. 📋 Task setup
4. 🚀 Execution with detailed agent outputs
5. 💾 Final report saved

### Output Files

All outputs saved to `outputs/` folder:
- `job_search_report_[timestamp].txt` - **Full combined report**
- `job_search_[timestamp].txt` - Job listings only
- `skills_analysis_[timestamp].txt` - Skills roadmap only
- `interview_prep_[timestamp].txt` - Interview questions only
- `career_advisory_[timestamp].txt` - Career advice only

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Job Search Parameters

**Option 1:** Edit `main.py` directly

```python
JOB_ROLE = "Product Manager"
LOCATION = "Remote"
NUM_RESULTS = 15
```

**Option 2:** Edit `src/config.py` to change defaults

```python
DEFAULT_JOB_ROLE = "Software Engineer"
DEFAULT_LOCATION = "New York"
DEFAULT_NUM_RESULTS = 10
```

### Modify Agent Behavior

Want agents to focus on different things? Edit agent backstories in `src/agents.py`:

```python
# Example: Make Skills Advisor focus on online courses
backstory=(
    'You are a learning specialist who specializes in online education '
    'platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and DataCamp. You always recommend '
    'specific courses with links...'
)
```

### Add New Agents

Want a 5th agent (e.g., Salary Negotiation Coach)? See [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for a step-by-step guide.

### Change LLM Model

Using a different Claude model:

```python
# src/config.py
CLAUDE_MODEL = "claude-opus-4-20250514"  # More powerful but slower
# or
CLAUDE_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5-20250815"  # Faster and cheaper
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

Verify your setup with tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run only tool tests
uv run pytest tests/test_tools.py

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Configuration Error: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set"

**Solution:** Make sure you've created `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) and added your API key.

### "HTTP Error 401" from Adzuna API

**Solution:** Check that your Adzuna credentials are correct in `.env`. The App ID should be just numbers, the API key is a long string.

### "Module not found" errors

**Solution:** Make sure you've installed dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Agents are taking too long / timing out

**Solution:**
1. Reduce `NUM_RESULTS` to 3-5 jobs
2. Check your internet connection
3. Adzuna API might be slow - wait and retry

### "Rate limit exceeded" from Anthropic

**Solution:** You've hit the API rate limit. Wait a few minutes or upgrade your Anthropic plan.

## 📚 How It Works

### Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────┐
│   main.py   │  Entry point, delegates to src/core/legacy_run.py
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       └─> run_legacy_flow() (src/core/legacy_run.py)
           ├─> Step 1: Job Search (calls Adzuna API tool directly,
           │           then Claude summarizes the results)
           ├─> Step 2: Skills Advisor (analyzes jobs via Claude)
           ├─> Step 3: Interview Coach (generates questions via Claude)
           └─> Step 4: Career Advisor (strategic advice via Claude)
               └─> Sequential execution
                   └─> Each step's prompt lives in src/prompts/
                       └─> Results saved & passed to the next step
```

### Step Flow

1. **Job Search step** calls Adzuna API → finds 5 jobs in Los Angeles
2. **Skills Advisor step** receives job listings → analyzes required skills → creates learning roadmap
3. **Interview Coach step** receives job listings → generates 8-10 questions per role → provides STAR method guidance
4. **Career Advisor step** receives job listings → gives resume tips, LinkedIn optimization, networking strategies

All steps use **Claude (Anthropic)** directly via `src/llm.py`.

### Key Technologies

- **Anthropic Claude** - Direct SDK access via `src/llm.py`
- **SQLite** - System of record for the stateful redesign (`src/db/`)
- **typer** - CLI framework (`jobsearch` command, see `src/cli.py`)
- **Adzuna API** - Real job search data
- **Python 3.10+** - Modern Python with type hints
