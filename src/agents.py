Agent definitions for the Job Search AI Agent System.

This module defines all AI agents that work together to help you with your
job search. Each agent has a specific role, goal, and expertise area.

In CrewAI, agents are like team members with specialized skills. They can:
- Use tools (like the job search API)
- Delegate tasks to other agents
- Collaborate to solve complex problems

Author: Claude Builder Club @ UC Irvine
Workshop: Intro to AI Agents (October 20, 2025)

Best Practices Applied:
- Anthropic: Clear role definitions with specific, measurable goals
- Anthropic: Rich backstories to give agents context and personality
- Anthropic: Chain-of-thought reasoning enabled through verbose mode
- CrewAI: Role-based agent architecture for natural task decomposition
- CrewAI: Delegation patterns for complex multi-step workflows
